## How To Deploy

Omg foreals, I have to do deployment notes too??? Yep...

Make sure to write notes about deployment, is it just merging to master to trigger [Github Actions Pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGEumlRlqHc)

## Diagrams

It's always nice to have some diagrams that will help show the high level design. Only do this when appplies

## Contributing

Sometimes is nice to tell people to go to another documentation :-( to make sure this readme doesn't get too long. So might as well create a contribution guidline markdown file and link it here. [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/meroware) this will help you know the rules of how to contribute.

## Code Owners

* **Some dude that wants credit** - *Yep I did the whole project, no one helped. Sigh.. I'm joking it was a team effort* - [Here is my profile](https://github.com/meroware)

It is best to just have a code owners setup. Checkout [Setup code owners in github repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-code-owners)

## License

Most like MIT License because we like open sourcing but it can be whatever license you like - Again we want to put the license in a different file to not make the readme too big [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)

## Acknowledgments

* Do we need to give credit to other people or groups? May be fun to share the love here.

## Code Owners

- _Yep I did the whole project, no one helped. Sigh.. I'm joking it was a lot of reasearch_ - [Here is my profile](https://github.com/JuanFe)

## License

Most like MIT License because we like open sourcing but it can be whatever license you like - Again we want to put the license in a different file to not make the readme too big [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md)
